## Introduction

Since my return to Sierra Leone at the end of January, I have lived in Lakka and my day often starts with breakfast on the balcony of my apartment on the beach.

Once upon a time evergreen forest met the beach but now, as the photo at the top shows, the hills, below the [Western Area Peninsula Forest National Park](https://datazone.birdlife.org/site/factsheet/western-area-peninsula-forest-national-park), are deforested. The one remaining large tree along the narrow, sandy beach is a cotton tree (*Ceiba pentandra*), a little to the right/south of my apartment. The beach stretches unbroken for 1.5km to the south to Hamilton. To the north is 2.5km of beach to Sugarland, with just inland 1km to the north of me the c0.2km of irrigated cultivation of Ogoo Farm. Patches of mangrove and open water occur just behind the beach north of Ogoo Farm and at Hamilton.  I've yet to explore anywhere a couple of hundred metres beyond my apartment, but will accumulate sightings here as I do.     

## Regular species

If the Red List of Sierra Leone's [Globally Threatened Species]() sets your priorities, then urban Freetown's star and only threatened species is [**Hooded Vulture**](). A few more in this category (LIST THEM, YC HORNBILL, PICATHARTES, OTHERS?) occur within Freetown (URBAN, RURAL??).

Whilst people will tell you there used to be more Hooded Vultures in the city, any decline here has not been documented and is anecdote. They remain widespread in the city and 10 or so lift themselves up from roosts I'm assuming are nearby each morning.

The other daily raptors are **Yellow-billed Kite** in the dry season and **Shikra**, a relatively recent colonist and now widespread resident.

That is all waiting for daylight. if I'm awake before dawn during the rains, which for me so far means May, the first song, some half hour before sunrise, is **African Thrush**. In no particular order, vocalisations ome soon after sunrise from **Common Bulbul**, **Grey-headed Sparrow**, **Pied Crow**. The phone wires are a popular perch, with different species in season; a hunting perch for **Blue-cheeekd Bee-eaters**, dry season visitors from North African breeding grounds; and a singing and displaying perch for Freetown's one widespread sunbird, **Variable Sunbird**, ni the dry season and the noisy **Woodland Kingfisher** which appeared with the rains.

Of hirundines and swifts, so far I have onlly see the two common urban species; **red-chested Swallow** and, less frequently, **Little Swift**.
