## Introduction

Since my return to Sierra Leone at the end of January, I have lived in Lakka and my day often starts with breakfast on the balcony of my apartment on the beach.

Once upon a time evergreen forest met the beach but now, as the photo at the top shows, the hills, below the Western Area Peninsula Forest National park, are deforested. The one remaining large tree along the beach, a cotton tree (*Ceiba pentandra*) 

Nevertheless there are birds and as most visitors and residents will spend some time in urban Freetown, worth documenting. [Maps.me](), (SIDE NOTE ON CAPABILITIES) tells me I am some 800m from the Atlantic Ocean, partly visible between new builds and providing glorious sunsets, and c1km from the deforested foothills below [Western Area Peninsula Forest](), a National Park and Important Bird Area. A few economically useful trees remain in the larger compounds and there is some irrigated farmland between me and the ocean, which I have yet to visit.

## Regular species

If the Red List of Sierra Leone's [Globally Threatened Species]() sets your priorities, then urban Freetown's star and only threatened species is [**Hooded Vulture**](). A few more in this category (LIST THEM, YC HORNBILL, PICATHARTES, OTHERS?) occur within Freetown (URBAN, RURAL??).

Whilst people will tell you there used to be more Hooded Vultures in the city, any decline here has not been documented and is anecdote. They remain widespread in the city and 10 or so lift themselves up from roosts I'm assuming are nearby each morning.

The other daily raptors are **Yellow-billed Kite** in the dry season and **Shikra**, a relatively recent colonist and now widespread resident.

That is all waiting for daylight. if I'm awake before dawn during the rains, which for me so far means May, the first song, some half hour before sunrise, is **African Thrush**. In no particular order, vocalisations ome soon after sunrise from **Common Bulbul**, **Grey-headed Sparrow**, **Pied Crow**. The phone wires are a popular perch, with different species in season; a hunting perch for **Blue-cheeekd Bee-eaters**, dry season visitors from North African breeding grounds; and a singing and displaying perch for Freetown's one widespread sunbird, **Variable Sunbird**, ni the dry season and the noisy **Woodland Kingfisher** which appeared with the rains.

Of hirundines and swifts, so far I have onlly see the two common urban species; **red-chested Swallow** and, less frequently, **Little Swift**.
