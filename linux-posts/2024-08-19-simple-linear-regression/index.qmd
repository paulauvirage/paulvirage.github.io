## Introduction

A new work task for me is to leave for posterity (!) the material from my short courses at Fourah Bay College. As a lot of this is live coding in `R` I've decide to supplement the usual slides, code and written notes with screen-casts mixing slides with my talking over live coding in R Studio.

After some trial and error I decided to go for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for recording, [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), with which I was already familiar from editing bird calls, for tidying the video sound, a line of [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to pull it all together and the multi-media player [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ubuntu.html) to play and so test the video. Below is my rationale, procedures and troubleshooting for the four steps.

## OBS Studio

OBS Studio seems to be the most richly featured of the free video recording software for Linux. With Ubuntu now using [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), it is also seems to be one of the few options

[I'll keep saying "seems to be" where things are way outside my expertise and my evidence is no more than a bit of Google or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) search]{.aside}

Installation is three lines of `bash` in the terminal:

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE

# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install ffmpeg obs-studio
```

## Audacity

-   `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity`;
-   `sudo apt update` and
-   `sudo apt-get install audacity`

## FFmpeg

`ffmpeg -i video1.mkv -i audio1.wav -c:v copy -map 0:v -map 1:a -y output.mkv`

## VLC

Installed from the Ubuntu App Center
